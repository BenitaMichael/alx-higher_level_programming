The ``2-matrix_divided`` module
===============================
This module defines a matrix division function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Importing function from the module:

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divide

CASES
*Dividing a matrix by 0:

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]], 0)
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero (div canâ€™t be equal to 0)

*Dividing a matrix by a float number:

    >>> matrix_divided([[10, 30], [20. 40]], 5.3)
    [[1.89, 5.66], [3.77, 7.7]]

*Passing an empty matrix:

    >>> matrix_divided([], 2)
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Passing a tuple as an argument:

    >>> matrix_divided((16, 32, 48, 4)
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Dividing a matrix which its rows don't have the same size:

    >>> matrix_divided([[24, 48], [2.81, 8.4, 20], [-8]], 3)
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

*Dividing a matrix which its elements aren't integer/float numbers 2:

    >>> matrix_divided([["2"], ["4", "8"], ["1", "3", "5"]], 7)
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Dividing a matrix which some of its elements aren't integer/float numbers:

    >>> matrix_divided([[9.2, 6], ['69', 1.3], [10.1, '24'], [5.3, '5.5', 20.1]], 5)
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Dividing a matrix which its elements aren't integer/float numbers:

    >>> matrix_divided([["Hello", "Bonita"], ["Hello", "Koliseyenum"]], 10)
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Passing a matrix which one of its elements is an empty list:

    >>> matrix_divided([[4.2, 9.8], [7, -2]], 8, [])
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Passing a matrix which one of its elements is a tuple:

    >>> matrix_divided([[1, -1], (1, -5), [2, -10]], 1)
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

*Passing div as a string

    >>> matrix_divided([[24, 48], [72, 96]], "24")
    TypeError: div must be a number

*Passing div as a list

    >>> matrix_divided([[5.9, 9.5], [6.3, 3.6]], [9])
    TypeError: div must be a number
